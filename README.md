# MNN-Torch

MNN-Torch is a PyTorch-based implementation for Memristor-based Neural Networks (MNN). The project enables the construction and training of spiking neural networks (SNNs) utilizing memristive components for more efficient neural computation.

## Installation

To install the package:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Features

- Memristive layers for enhanced performance.
- Integration with standard PyTorch layers.
- Flexible neural network design for SNNs.
